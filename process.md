# Specification Development Process

## Decision-Making

Portolan specification decisions are made collaboratively by the core team:

- Chris Holmes (@cholmes)
- Nissim Lebovits (@nlebovits)
- Maxym Malynowsky

## Open Questions

Open questions and unresolved design issues are tracked in [QUESTIONS.md](QUESTIONS.md).

## Architectural Decisions

Key architectural decisions and their rationale are documented in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

## Changes and Contributions

- Changes to the specification are proposed via pull request
- PRs are discussed before merging
- Consensus among core team members is required for changes to core requirements

## Versioning

TBD: Semantic versioning strategy for the specification itself
